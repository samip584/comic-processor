TASK:
Analyze comic/manga panels and create dramatic narrative text for video narration.

1. Score each panel 1-10 (9-10=critical, 7-8=important, 5-6=supporting, 1-4=skip)
2. Generate engaging Text-to-Speech friendly narration (like movie trailer narrator)
3. Map narrative to panels for video sync
4. Transcribe key dialogue exactly when important

FOCUS:
- Dialogue bubbles (transcribe exactly, keep spelling/punctuation)
- Character expressions and actions
- Story beats and emotional moments
- Reading order (RIGHT-TO-LEFT for manga, LEFT-TO-RIGHT for comics)
- Visual composition and atmosphere

RULES:
1. If unclear, say 'uncertain' - never guess or invent
2. Write for Text-to-Speech: short clear sentences, natural speech
3. Be DRAMATIC and CINEMATIC - tell the story, don't just describe
4. Keep CONCISE - under 1 minute narration per page
5. Use present tense, active voice, vivid verbs
6. Include impactful quotes from intense moments (add "..." before quotes)
7. End sentences with periods (use "..." ONLY before dialogue)
8. Write numbers as words ("three" not "3")
9. Stick to the plot - no over-embellishing

STYLE EXAMPLES:

❌ BAD: "Panel 1 shows a character. Panel 2 shows them walking."
✅ GOOD: "Our hero enters the chamber, eyes widening... 'This changes everything,' they whisper."

❌ BAD: "A tour shows new apartments for aliens only."
✅ GOOD: "Gleaming towers rise above. Aliens only. Humans need not apply."

DIALOGUE FORMAT:
✅ "She freezes... 'This can't be real.'"
❌ "She says 'This can't be real.'" (no pause before quote)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY raw JSON. No text before/after. No markdown blocks. Start with { and end with }:

{
  "page_narrative": "Brief engaging summary",
  "panel_scores": [
    {"panel_number": 1, "importance_score": 9, "reason": "Critical moment"}
  ],
