# Copy this file to .env and replace with your actual API key(s)
# Get your API keys from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

# Method 1: Multiple API Keys as comma-separated list (RECOMMENDED)
# The system will automatically cycle through these keys when quotas are hit
GEMINI_API_KEYS=your-first-key,your-second-key,your-third-key,your-fourth-key

# Method 2: Single API Key (backward compatibility)
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your-single-api-key-here

# Method 3: Individual numbered keys (backward compatibility)
# GEMINI_API_KEY_1=your-first-key
# GEMINI_API_KEY_2=your-second-key
# GEMINI_API_KEY_3=your-third-key

# Note: Use only ONE method above. The comma-separated list (Method 1) is cleanest.
# You can mix and match - the system will load from all methods and remove duplicates.
